## NMS Distance Logger

A super simple script that I used to log distance for my "Better ETA" No Man's sky project.
At fixed intervals, it will record the distance to the planet from NMS.exe's process memory and record it into log.csv.
Note that if you decide to use this, you'll need to change the address to whatever address you want to pull from.
